### 🤔 What?

Mastospawner allows you to create new [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) instances in **30 minutes or less**.
Mastodon should be decentralized. A few popular servers are no better than the tech giants Mastodon was designed to replace. Anyone should be able to host their own instance!

Mastospawner allows you to moderate, scale, and administrate your Mastodon instance without ever needing the command line.

### 😎 Who?

Mastospawner is built by [Elijah Wilson](https://github.com/tizz98) who is passionate about ActivityPub and the Fediverse.
